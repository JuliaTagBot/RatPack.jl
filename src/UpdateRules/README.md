update_info needs to have all fields checked defined

meaning explained:
	output = "probabilistic" or "deterministic"

	       deterministic means that, from ratings, we can estimate
	           who will win by r_i > r_j means i beats j

               probabistic means ratings lead to a model giving
	            p_{ij} as a function of r_i, r_j



could add in the "sense" of ratings -- usually higher values are
better


logit-Colley

logit-Massey


  r_i - r_j = logit(p_{ij})

     (or logistic??)



add example to constructors docs, of defaults etc
